                    <p>
                        Our choices cause the future to branch out. A person’s presence branches and multiplies through shadows, reflections, photographs and digital means. Memory is another kind of branching, allowing for the superposition of different times and events. The method of branching, then, transforms the original in various ways, creating the basis for new interpretations, relationships, and opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of the 'choices' in our lives might be made unconsciously. Imagine a dog who suddenly appears, snags a piece of bread from your hand, and walks away while you are debating whether to choose ham or egg as an ingredient for your sandwich. We are surprisingly blind to what is around us, just as we are oblivious to the gaze of a hungry dog. In the Branching Room, we will attempt to once more meet the gaze of the dog and once more be deprived of bread.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nameless relationships are of greater interest than named ones. How are relationships between people built, changed, broken, and rebuilt again in the course of everyday life? In the Branching Room, performers and audience will interact with elements of sound, light, photography, and games to explore the consequences of choices and the simultaneity of past, present, and future.
                    </p>

                        Artist and performance art platform Ham Tamago Sandwich member Stephan E. Perez, is about to leave Japan, where he has spent the last 8 years. In preparation for his departure, he brings together people involved in his early and recent performance work at the Kabukicho art space "Decameron". They will be joined by the audience, including you, for reflection and discussion.
